The file "COMPAS_crowdsourcing_data.csv" contains the crowdsourcing 
results for ProPublica COMPAS dataset.

It contains 440 examples (y label ratio ~= 1:1), and each example has 
11 crowdsourcing answers.

The first line of a given CSV file contains the information of each 
column. The contents are as follows.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Meta features>
example_id: IDs for identifying each example
true_label: Whether the crime was actually committed within two years 
   (correct answer, true y)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Features provided to crowdworkers>
age_category: A classification of age. It contains "less than 25", 
   "25 to 45", and "greater than 45".
age: Age (raw value)
crime_level: The level of crime. It is composed of "Felony (serious 
   crime)" and "Misdemeanor (light crime)".
num_of_crimes: Number of previous crimes (excluding current crime)
stay_in_prison: A term of imprisonment
gender: Male and female
race: Caucasian and non-caucasian
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Crowdsourcing results>
ans_1 ~ ans_11: Results from 11 unique workers. Probabilities of recidivism 
   within two years determined by each worker for the sample. (lowest:1, 
   highest: 4)
worker_id_1 ~ worker_id_11: ID assigned to each worker (converted value 
   of the AMT worker ID). The AMT worker ID is not disclosed for privacy.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This data shows the results of crowdsourcing in true y label ratio 1:1.
In comparison, the validation set used in our experiments does not have
a y label ratio of 1:1 because we do not have knowledge of the true labels.
Instead, we take a random subset of the (unlabeled) training data and
crowdsource the labels, which preserves the original true label distribution.

To adjust the quality of crowdsourced labels, one can compute worker-specific
accuracies by grouping the answers by worker_id and filter out poor performers.
